#+title: SIMULACRUM

* Roadmap

** Setup and familiarize with libs and articles

** Core System Design

*** Basic Architecture
= data structures for voxel representation chunks, octrees
- rendering pipeline vertex ,frag ,frame buff
- input handling and camera control

*** Basic Funcs
- creating visualizing voxel scenes
- handling basic user input, camera mov
- managing memory fo efficient voxel data

** Rendering and Lighting

*** Advanced Rendering Techniques
- implement lighting models diffuse, specular, shadows
- integrate textures and materials for visual variety
- optimize rendering performance for larger scenes and higher frame rates

*** World Generation & Chunk Management
- implement a basic world generation system Perlin noise, procedural generation
- design and implement a chunk loading and unloading system for dynamic world updates
- optimize chunk generation and management for memory usage and performance

** Interaction and Gameplay

*** Player Interaction & Physics
- collision with voxel
- consider physics simulation for dynamic object interactions
- design and implement basic gameplay mechanics block placement, destruction

*** Polishing and Enhancement
- sounds
- UI
- refactor optimize
